## Why I prefered given tech stack and database ?

### Frontend
JavaScript: Essential for adding interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. Its versatility makes it a core part of both client-side and server-side development.

React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. React's component-based architecture allows for reusable components and efficient updates, enhancing development speed and user experience.

### Backend
JavaScript (Node.js): Using JavaScript on the backend with Node.js allows for a unified language across the entire application, simplifying development and maintenance.

Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Its simplicity and performance make it a great choice for building APIs and web servers.

Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It simplifies data validation, casting, and business logic, making it easier to work with MongoDB.

### Database
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that offers high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. Its flexible schema design aligns well with agile development practices, allowing for rapid iteration and adaptation to changing requirements.

### Cloud Storage
Cloudinary: A comprehensive cloud-based image and video management solution. It offers powerful APIs for uploading, transforming, and delivering media assets efficiently, making it ideal for modern web applications that require dynamic media content.
